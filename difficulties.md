# DIFFICULTIES


##HARDWARE/TIME
As the training process is computationally expensive we opted to train the model 
on Google cloud servers. In spite of the upgrade in hardware, time was still
a major bottleneck as a model on average took 22-24hrs to train.

##COSTS
There were fees associated to the servers and we ended up spending a significant 
portion of our allowance in order to train the model to the desired stage.

##DOCUMENTATION
The Tensorflow CycleGAN API documentation was very difficult to parse and as such
a lot of intellectual effort was expended trying to implement the CycleGAN 
architecture as faithfully as possible.
