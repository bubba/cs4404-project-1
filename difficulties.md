# DIFFICULTIES


### HARDWARE/TIME
As the training process is computationally expensive we opted to train the model 
on Google cloud servers. In spite of the upgrade in hardware, time was still
a major bottleneck as a model on average took 22-24hrs to train.

### COSTS
There were fees associated with the servers and we ended up spending a significant 
portion of our allowance training the models to the desired stage.

### DOCUMENTATION
The Tensorflow CycleGAN API documentation was very difficult to parse and as such
a lot of intellectual effort was expended trying to implement the CycleGAN 
architecture as faithfully as possible.
